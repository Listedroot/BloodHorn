This project is dedicated to my friend Taif. who was 21 years old.
who is also known as [UnpopularOpinion](https://discordapp.com/users/iprograminc)
Taif wasn’t just someone I built code with . he was someone I could always count on. Whether it was brainstorming ideas late at night, fixing a problem I couldn’t figure out. or just sending something random to make me laugh. he was always around. He believed in this project and believed in me. even when I didn’t.

He didn’t ask for credit or praise. He just helped because that’s the kind of person he was.

If this project moves forward, it’s because of the energy and encouragement Taif gave it from the beginning. And if it ever helps someone else, that’s part of his impact too.

Thank you, Taif. Rest In Peace.
